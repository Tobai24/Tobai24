# **👋 Hi, I’m Tobi**

**`Tobi(Medical student/Machine learning engineer)`**

Hey there! 👋 I'm a final-year medical student 🩺 with a passion for blending healthcare and tech 🤖, especially in nuclear medicine imaging and AI. 💡 When I'm not exploring radiomics 🔬 or advancing patient care 🏥, you’ll catch me sharing my love for learning as a volunteer tutor 📚 or crafting engaging content to make complex topics super simple! 🎨✨  

From breaking down logistic regression to geeking out over radiotherapies 💊, I’m all about turning science into a fun adventure! ✨   

Let’s innovate, educate, and have some fun along the way! 🎉🚀  

- 👀 I’m interested in advancing nuclear medicine imaging through the application of artificial intelligence and radiomics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer vision
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source project
